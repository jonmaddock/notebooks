    "# Feasible Inequality Constraints in Process\n",
    "\n",
    "When running Process with inequality constraints, it appears that for converged solutions some of the constraints are violated by a small amount. This needs to be fixed for accurate reliability analysis work, where sensitivity to small constraint violations is important. The solution should be truly feasible; i.e. no constraints violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular Process run of large-tokamak\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the large-tokamak regression test input file (`lt_original_IN.DAT`) and run it. The constraint residuals for limit equations are all listed as equality constraints (`lt_original_MFILE.DAT`):\n",
    "\n",

    "As all the constraints are treated a equalities, some are negative and some positive.\n",

    "## Convert to inequality constraints\n",

    "Comment out f-value iteration variables in input file:\n",

    "```\n",
    "all commented out: f-values removed as optismisation parameters; not allowed to vary (`lt_ineqs_no_f_values`). `neqns` is also specified so Process differentiates between equality and inequality constraints (`lt_ineqs_IN.DAT`).\n",

    "Process has produced a solution with a violated constraint. This is what we want to avoid.\n",

    "## Modify VMCON convergence criterion to prevent violated constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In VMCON's convergence criterion, added:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if convergence_info < epsilon:\n",
    "    # All ineqs positive, i.e. feasible\n",
    "    if np.all(result.ie >= 0.0):\n",
    "        print(\"Converged, cons satisfied\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Converged, but cons violated\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "On re-running `lt_ineqs_IN.DAT`, the `convergence-info` is below epsilon a few times before finally converging with all inequality constraints being positive (feasible): see `lt_ineqs_mod_vmcon_MFILE.DAT`. The result is a truly feasible solution, with all inequality constraints satisfied."
